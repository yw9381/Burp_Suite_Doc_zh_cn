            </li>
            <li>
                You can pause and resume individual tasks, or all tasks together.

            </li>
            <li>
                You can view the <a href="issue-activity.html">issue activity</a> from any audit tasks that are running, to see vulnerabilities being reported in real time.

        <p>
            You can click the "pop-out" icon in the corner of each panel to show it as a separate window, so you can keep it visible while working in other areas of Burp Suite.
