        <h1>Payload Processing</h1>
        <p>
            The payloads generated by the configured <a href="types.html">payload type</a> can be
            further manipulated using various payload <a href="#payload-processing-rules">processing rules</a> and <a href="#payload-encoding">payload
            encoding</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="payload-processing-rules"> Payload Processing Rules </h2>
        <p>
            You can define rules to perform various processing tasks on each payload before it is used. The defined
            rules are executed in sequence, and can be toggled on and off to help debug any problems with the
            configuration. Payload processing rules are useful in many kinds of situation where you need to generate
            unusual payloads, or need to wrap payloads up within a wider structure or encoding scheme prior to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following types of rule are available:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Add prefix</strong> - This adds a literal prefix before the payload.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add suffix</strong> - This adds a literal suffix after the payload.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Match / replace</strong> - This replaces any parts of the payload that match a specific regular
                expression, with a literal string.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Substring</strong> - This extracts a sub-portion of the payloads, starting from a specified
                offset (0-indexed) and up to a specified length.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reverse substring</strong> - This functions as for the substring rule, but the end offset is
                specified counting backwards from the end of the payload, and the length is counted backwards from the
                end offset.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Modify case</strong> - This modifies the case of the payload, if applicable. The same options
                are available as for the <a href="types.html#case-modification"> case modification</a> payload
                type.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Encode</strong> - This encodes the payload using various schemes: URL, HTML, Base64, ASCII hex
                or constructed strings for various platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Decode</strong> - This decodes the payload using various schemes: URL, HTML, Base64 or ASCII
                hex.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hash</strong> - This carries out a hashing operation on the payload.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add raw payload</strong> - This adds the raw payload value before or after the current processed
                value. It can be useful, for example, if you need to submit the same payload in both raw and hashed
                form.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Skip if matches regex</strong> - This checks whether the current processed value matches a
                specified regular expression, and if so, skips the payload and moves onto the next one. This can be
                useful, for example, if you know that a parameter value must have a minimum length and want to skip any
                values in a list that are shorter than this length.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Invoke Burp extension</strong> - This invokes a <a href="../../extender.html">Burp extension</a> to
                process the payloads. The extension must have registered an Intruder payload processor. You can select
                the required processor from the list of available processors that have been registered by currently
                loaded extensions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="payload-encoding">Payload Encoding</h2>
        <p>
            You can configure which characters within the payload should be URL-encoded for safe transmission within
            HTTP requests. Any configured URL-encoding is applied last, after any <a href="#payload-processing-rules"> payload processing
            rules</a> have executed.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is recommended to use this setting for final URL-encoding, rather than a payload processing rule, because
            the <a href="../options.html#grep-payloads">payload grep</a> option can be used to check responses for
            echoed payloads before the final URL-encoding is applied.
