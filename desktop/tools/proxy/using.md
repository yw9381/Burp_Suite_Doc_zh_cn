        <h1>Using Burp Proxy</h1>
        <p>
            The Proxy tool lies at the heart of Burp's <a href="../../penetration-testing/index.html">user-driven workflow</a>, and
            gives you a direct view into how your target application works "under the hood". It operates as a web proxy
            server, and sits as a man-in-the-middle between your browser and destination web servers. This lets you
            intercept, inspect and modify the raw traffic passing in both directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the application employs HTTPS, Burp breaks the SSL connection between your browser and the server, so
            that even encrypted data can be viewed and modified within the Proxy.
        </p>

                    Burp Proxy</a>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2 id="getting-set-up">Getting Set Up</h2>
        <p>
            Setting up Burp and your browser to work with each other involves the following elements. If you need more
            help on these items, please see the help on <a href="../../getting-started/index.html">Getting started with Burp
            Suite</a>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Proxy listener</strong> - Burp uses <a href="options/index.html#proxy-listeners">Proxy listeners</a> to accept requests from your browser. The default Burp listener, on port 8080 of your IPv4 loopback
                interface, is normally sufficient for general-purpose testing. Burp will show an alert in the <a href="../../dashboard/index.html">dashboard event log</a> on startup if it is not able to open this port (usually
                because another application is using it). You can modify the default listener and add new ones via the <a href="options/index.html#proxy-listeners"> Proxy listener options</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Browser proxy config</strong> - You need to configure your browser to use the Burp Proxy
                listener as its proxy server, for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Burp CA certificate</strong> - Since Burp breaks SSL connections between your browser and
                servers, your browser will by default show a warning message if you visit an HTTPS site via Burp Proxy.
                This is because the browser does not recognize Burp's SSL certificate, and infers that your traffic may
                be being intercepted by a third-party attacker. To use Burp effectively with SSL connections, you really
                need to <a href="options/installing-ca-certificate.html"> install Burp's Certificate Authority master
                certificate</a> in your browser, so that it trusts the certificates generated by Burp.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When you have things set up, visit any URL in your browser, and go to the <a href="intercept.html">Intercept
            tab</a> in Burp Proxy. If everything is working, you should see an HTTP request displayed for you to view
            and modify. You should also see entries appearing in the <a href="history.html">Proxy history</a> tab.
            You will need to forward HTTP messages as they appear in the Intercept tab, in order to continue browsing.
        </p>
        <h2 id="intercepting-requests-and-responses">Intercepting Requests and Responses</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="intercept.html">Intercept tab</a> displays individual HTTP requests and responses that
            have been intercepted by Burp Proxy for review and modification. This feature is a key part of Burp's
            user-driven workflow:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Manually reviewing intercepted messages is often key to understanding the application's attack surface
                in detail.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modifying request parameters often allows you to quickly identify common security vulnerabilities.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Intercepted requests and responses are displayed in an <a href="../../functions/message-editor/index.html">HTTP
            message editor</a>, which contains numerous features designed to help you quickly analyze and manipulate the
            messages.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, Burp Proxy intercepts only request messages, and does not intercept requests for URLs with
            common file extensions that are often not directly interesting when testing (images, CSS, and static
            JavaScript). You can change this default behavior in the <a href="options/index.html#intercepting-http-requests-and-responses">interception
            options</a>. For example, you can configure Burp to only intercept <a href="../target/scope.html"> in-scope</a> requests containing parameters, or to intercept all responses containing HTML. Furthermore, you may often
            want to turn off Burp's interception altogether, so that all HTTP messages are automatically forwarded
            without requiring user intervention. You can do this using the master interception toggle, in the <a href="intercept.html"> Intercept tab</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="using-the-proxy-history">Using the Proxy History</h2>
        <p>
            Burp maintains a <a href="history.html">full history</a> of all requests and responses that have
            passed through the Proxy. This enables you to review the browser-server conversation to understand how the
            application functions, or carry out key testing tasks. Sometimes you may want to completely disable
            interception in the <a href="intercept.html"> Intercept tab</a>, and freely browse a part of the
            application's functionality, before carefully reviewing the resulting requests and responses in the Proxy
            history.
        </p>
        <p>
            Burp provides the following functions to help you analyze the Proxy history:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <a href="history.html#history-table">history table</a> can be sorted by clicking on any column header
                (clicking a header cycles through ascending sort, descending sort, and unsorted). This lets you quickly
                group similar items and identify any anomalous items.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can use the <a href="history.html#proxy-history-display-filter">display filter</a> to hide items with various
                characteristics.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can <a href="history.html#proxy-history-annotations">annotate</a> items with highlights and comments, to
                describe their purpose or identify interesting items to come back to later.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can open additional views of the history using the <a href="history.html#proxy-history-testing-workflow">context
                menu</a>, to apply different filters or help test access controls.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="burp-proxy-testing-workflow">Burp Proxy testing workflow</h2>
        <p>
            A key part of Burp's <a href="../../penetration-testing/index.html">user-driven workflow</a> is the ability to send
            interesting items between Burp tools to carry out different tasks. For example, having observed an
            interesting request in the Proxy, you might:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Quickly perform a <a href="../../scanning/index.html#启动扫描">vulnerability scan</a> of just that
                request, using Burp Scanner.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send the request to <a href="../repeater/using.html">Repeater</a> to manually modify the request and
                reissue it over and over.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send the request to <a href="../intruder/using.html">Intruder</a> to perform various types of automated
                customized attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send the request to <a href="../sequencer/index.html">Sequencer</a> to analyze the quality of randomness in a
                token returned in the response.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You can perform all these actions and various other using the context menus that appear in both the <a href="intercept.html">Intercept tab</a> and the <a href="history.html">Proxy history</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="key-configuration-options">Key Configuration Options</h2>
        <p>
            For more specialized testing tasks, or when working with unusual applications, you may need to modify some
            of Burp Proxy's numerous <a href="options/index.html">options</a>:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You might need to modify the Proxy listener, to bind to <a href="options/index.html#binding">different
                interfaces</a>, <a href="options/index.html#request-handling">redirect requests</a> to
                different hosts, handle <a href="options/index.html#certificate"> server SSL certificates</a> differently, or support <a href="options/invisible.html">invisible proxying</a> for
                non-proxy-aware clients.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can configure the Proxy to automatically <a href="options/index.html#response-modification">modify HTTP
                responses</a> in various systematic ways; for example, to unhide hidden form fields, remove JavaScript
                form validation, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can configure <a href="options/index.html#match-and-replace"> match / replace</a> rules to automatically
                change the content of requests and responses.
            </li>
        </ul>
